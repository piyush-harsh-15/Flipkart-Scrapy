# Flipkart-Scrapy
Using Beautiful Soup4, I scrapped the e-commerce website, Flipkart to list the product name, product price and the link to the product. At the end I generate a csv file to store all the results generated. For this example, I searched for "Samsung mobiles" and hence the csv files contains the list of Samsung phones which were available on the website.
